# Dorm Posters Challenge!

Welcome to your first day of college! As you move in to your dorm, you notice your dorm mates have gotten their posters confused. They've asked you to find their correct posters, and to style them so that they look good on the walls of their rooms. Open up `index.html` and move the posters to the appropriate rooms. Once you've divvied up the posters, style them according to the instructions in each person's `<div>` in `index.html`.
